# Patcherdev

## About Me
- 20 y/o web developer building tools, sites, and random projects that actually help people.
- 6ft, active on Discord as **_xyss_**.
- Heavy Python user — loves cooking up utilities, automation, and weird experiments in free time.
- Deep interest in security research, system testing, bug hunting, and pushing tech to its limits.
- Always reverse‑engineering something and finding new ways to break and improve systems.
- Biggest fear: seeing one of my creations get deprecated, archived, or wiped off the internet.
- I Sometimes Exploit Multi Billion Dollar Companys But NEVER Take Down One.
## What I Do
- Web development (frontend & backend).
- Python tools, CLIs, scripts, and automation.
- Security research and learning how systems behave under pressure.
- UI/UX experiments and HTML/CSS builds.
- Random projects that solve problems people didn’t even know they had.

## Current Focus
- Building cleaner and faster workflows.
- Designing new utilities for developers and Discord power users.
- Exploring advanced Python patterns and security concepts.
- Improving my personal toolchain and setup.

## Find Me
